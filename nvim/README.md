## This is my PDE using [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) & [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)

#### The idea here is

- Neovim's growing so fast so I don't want to tinker where/what is the file I am looking for, only one single file called (control_center) to manage everything/anything, while the other files are just waiting my order (True OR False) to be loaded.
- People are fighting over the best neovim startup (\~24s, \~50s, \~100, etc...) well... mine is (\~170) & SUPER happy about it as long as having everything I want & faster than V\*\*\*\*e you know already :)

## Credits goes for the AWESOME Neovim maintainers, contributors, plugin authors & the community ofc
