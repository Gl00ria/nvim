## This is my PDE using [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)

#### The idea here is:

- Neovim's growing so fast so I don't want to tinker where/what is the file I am looking for, only one single file called (control_center) to manage everything/anything, while the other files are just waiting my order (True OR False) to be loaded.
- People are fighting over the best neovim startup (\~24s, \~50s, \~100, etc...) well... mine is (\~170) & SUPER happy about it as long as having everything I want & faster than V\*\*\*\*e you know already :)

#### The (control_center) file divided into multiple sections:

1. Neovide: settings for the [Neovim GUI Client](https://github.com/neovide/neovide).
2. Editor Options.
3. Edit (custom & plugins) keymaps.
4. Enable/Disable plugins:
   - Coding
   - Editor
   - UI
   - Themes
   - Utils
   - AIs
   - Games

## Credits goes for the AWESOME Neovim maintainers, contributors, plugin authors & the community ofc.
